    <div class="flex flex-col items-start justify-start gap-12px mt-54px">
      <h2>18. Risk of Uncertain Regulations and Enforcement Actions</h2>
      <p>The regulatory status of the Company and distributed ledger technology is unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions. The regulation of digital assets has become a primary target of regulation in all major countries in the world. It is impossible to predict how, when or whether regulatory agencies may apply existing regulations or create new regulations with respect to such technology and its applications, including the Company. Regulatory actions could negatively impact the Company in various ways. The Company its respective affiliates may cease operations in a jurisdiction in the event that regulatory actions, or changes to law or regulation, make it illegal to operate in such jurisdiction, or commercially undesirable to obtain the necessary regulatory approval(s) to operate in such jurisdiction.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="flex flex-col items-start justify-start gap-12px mt-54px">
      <h2>19. Risk of Inadequate Disclosure of Information</h2>
      <p>The Services are still under development and the design concepts, consensus mechanisms, algorithms, codes, and other technical details and parameters may be constantly and frequently updated and changed. Although the Site contains the most current information relating to the Company, it is not absolutely complete and may still be adjusted and updated by the Company from time to time.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="flex flex-col items-start justify-start gap-12px mt-54px">
      <h2>20. Risk of Competitors</h2>
      <p>Various types of decentralized applications and networks are emerging at a rapid rate, and the industry is increasingly competitive. It is possible that alternative networks could be established that utilize the same or similar code and protocol underlying the Company and attempt to re-create similar facilities. The Company may be required to compete with these alternative networks, which could negatively impact the Company.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="flex flex-col items-start justify-start gap-12px mt-54px">
      <h2>21. Risk of Failing to Develop</h2>
      <p>There is the risk that the development of the Company will not be executed or implemented as planned, for a variety of reasons, including without limitation the event of a decline in the prices of any digital asset, virtual currency or the Company, unforeseen technical difficulties, and shortage of development funds for activities.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="flex flex-col items-start justify-start gap-12px mt-54px">
      <h2>22. Risks Associated with Proof of Stake Protocols</h2>
      <p>Because the subject of the Company’s governance and other activities relates indirectly to certain proof of stake protocols, any malfunction, breakdown or abandonment of any such platform may have a material adverse effect on tokens or other products that are the subject of the Company’s governance aims. Moreover, advances in cryptography, or technical advances such as the development of quantum computing, could present risks to underlying proof of stake blockchains, tokens and related ecosystems, for example, by rendering ineffective cryptographic consensus mechanisms. The Company takes no responsibility for such risks and expressly disclaims same.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="flex flex-col items-start justify-start gap-12px mt-54px">
      <h2>23. Risk of Hacking and Security Weaknesses</h2>
      <p>Hackers or other malicious groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with the Company or underlying blockchains in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, malware attacks, denial of service attacks, consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks, smurfing and spoofing. Furthermore, because the Company and underlying blockchains are based on open-source software, there is a risk that a third party or a member of the Company team may intentionally or unintentionally introduce weaknesses into the core infrastructure of the Company or related blockchains, which could have negative consequences. The Company takes no responsibility for and expressly disclaims responsibility for such attacks/security weaknesses. Further, the Company shall bear no liability whatsoever, for any damage or interruptions caused by any computer viruses, spyware, scareware, Trojan horses, worms or other malware that may affect your computer or other equipment, or any phishing, spoofing or other attack.</p>
